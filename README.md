Certainly, let's go through an example scenario where you accidentally deleted a file, committed the changes, and pushed them to the remote repository. We'll use the steps mentioned earlier to recover the deleted file.

Assume you have a file named example.txt in your Git repository, and you accidentally deleted it. Here are the steps to restore it:

    Find the Commit Hash:

    bash

git log

Identify the commit hash where the example.txt file was deleted.

Create a New Branch (Optional but Recommended):

bash

git checkout -b restore-files

Use git revert:

bash

git revert -n <commit_hash>

Replace <commit_hash> with the commit hash where example.txt was deleted.

If you deleted multiple files in the same commit and only want to restore example.txt:

bash

git add path/to/example.txt
git commit -m "Restore example.txt"

Push the Changes:

bash

git push origin restore-files
